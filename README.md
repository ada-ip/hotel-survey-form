This is a simple hotel survey form. 

I practised basic html forms with different kind of form elements in this exercise. I also practised basic css styling and new properties and functionalities for me like box-shadow, setting an image as a background and setting opacity to it, and pseudo elements.

This form is only made of html and css.
